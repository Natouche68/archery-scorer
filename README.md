# Archery Scorer

**A tool that helps you count points in archery. ðŸŽ¯**

_âš  I made another version of this app. It uses Web Components instead of Svelte, has many problems, and doesn't work very well. I won't be updating the old version, but you can find it [here](https://github.com/Natouche68/archery-scorer-beta) if you need._

It is made using Svelte as the front-end framework and Vite as the build tool.
